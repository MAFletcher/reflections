What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You need to initialize a repository to let Git know which files your commits relate to.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows you to decide which files from your working directory you want to include in the commit. The value is that you don't have to include in a commit files you haven't changed -- so that narrows down the places you need to look if a bug shows up after a commit.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can stage all the files related to that one logical change and commit them simultaneousl, with one commit message explaining the nature of the change.
