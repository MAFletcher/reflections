When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You'd want to use it when you are making changes from a different computer or when another person is contributing work to your project.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might not be ready to move remote changes into your local repository -- especially if the remote changes were made by another person whose work you need to check.
