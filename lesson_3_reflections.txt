When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You'd want to use it when you are making changes from a different computer or when another person is contributing work to your project.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might not be ready to move remote changes into your local repository -- especially if the remote changes were made by another person whose work you need to check.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches are for separating out or isolating changes you make within a repository. A clone is a copy of a repository. A fork is essentially a clone of a repository on GitHub -- usually a repository that belongs to someone else and that you don't have permission to modify. It's helpful if you want to use someone else's repository as a starting point for a project of your own, or if you want to suggest changes to the owner of the original repository.
